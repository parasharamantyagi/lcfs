                                            Education Savings Plan for Canadian Children</strong></h1>
                                    <p>With the rising tuition costs of post-secondary education,
                                        it&#8217;s more important than ever to start saving for your
                                        child&#8217;s education as early as possible. One of the best
                                        ways to do this is through a Registered Education Savings Plan
                                        (RESP). But what is an RESP?</p>
                                    <p>This blog post will explain an RESP, how it works, and the
                                        benefits of opening one. Let&#8217;s get started.</p>
                                    <h2><strong>What Is RESP?</strong></h2>
                                    <p>RESP is tax-free savings account for a child’s future
                                        post-secondary education, partially funded by the Canadian
                                        government. The account grows tax-free, and the federal
                                        government contributes through the Canada Education Savings
                                        Grant (CESG).</p>
                                    <p>Three entities are involved in an RESP:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Subscriber</strong>: The person who opens and
                                            contributes to the account.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Beneficiary</strong>: The child who receives the
                                            contributions for education expenses. Family plans can have
                                            multiple beneficiaries.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Promoter</strong>: An organization that offers
                                            RESPs, such as a bank, credit union, or group scholarship
                                            provider.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h2><strong>Types Of RESPs</strong></h2>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Individual or Non-Family RESP Plans</strong>: With
                                            these plans, anyone can start saving for a beneficiary&#8217;s
                                            education by setting up an individual Registered Education
                                            Savings Plan (RESP). The subscriber does not need to be related
                                            to the beneficiary. They can make flexible contributions up to
                                            the annual limit, and the beneficiary may be eligible for the
                                            Canada Education Savings Grant and Canada Learning Bond.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Family RESP Plans</strong>: These plans involve one
                                            or more beneficiaries that must be related to the subscriber by
                                            blood or adoption. With these plans, the subscriber can
                                            self-direct the payment plan and make payments as they see fit.
                                            In addition, the subscriber can designate portions of the RESP
                                            for specific beneficiaries. The account&#8217;s earnings will
                                            be divided among beneficiaries, with one potentially receiving
                                            the Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Group RESP Plans</strong>: With a group RESP, you
                                            pool your contributions with those of other investors to save
                                            for a specified number of children who may or may not be
                                            related to you. These plans usually have more rules and
                                            restrictions than other types of RESPs and fixed payment
                                            schedules. If you miss a payment, there may be penalties
                                            involved. The earnings from your and other investors&#8217;
                                            contributions are pooled together and usually invested in
                                            low-risk investments selected by the group scholarship
                                            provider. This way, the money can grow over time while still
                                            being accessible when your child or children reach college age.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h2><strong>What Are The Benefits Of RESPs?</strong></h2>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Savings Grow Tax-Free</strong>: With a Registered
                                            Education Savings Plan (RESP), the money you save for your
                                            child’s post-secondary education grows tax-free.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Contributions Are Not Tax Deductible</strong>:
                                            Unlike Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSPs),
                                            contributions to an RESP are not tax deductible.</li>
                                        <li><strong>RESP Government Grants</strong>: To help you save
                                            for your child&#8217;s future education, the government will
                                            match 20% of your RESP contributions up to $2,500 per year.
                                            That means an extra $500 in your RESP each year. Beneficiaries
                                            of an RESP can also receive the Canada Learning Bond and the
                                            Canada Education Savings Grant and grant money for higher
                                            education.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Anyone Can Contribute</strong>: Parents,
                                            grandparents, relatives and friends can contribute to an RESP.
                                            Even strangers can contribute to educational assistance
                                            payments if they are prepared to name the child as the
                                            beneficiary.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h2><strong>What Are The Limitations?</strong></h2>
                                    <p>Despite the many benefits of RESPs, there are some limitations
                                        to consider:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The biggest limitation is that any child can only receive a
                                            maximum lifetime total of $7,200 from the CESG.</li>
                                        <li>There is no annual limit on contributions made by the
                                            subscriber when setting up multiple plans, but there is a
                                            lifetime contribution limit per beneficiary of $50,000.
                                            Over-contributing to an RESP will result in monthly taxes,
                                            which must be withdrawn to avoid accruing interest. A tax-free
                                            savings account has an annual limit of $6,000 for 2022 with no
                                            lifetime limit.</li>
                                        <li>If the subscriber of an RESP dies intestate (without a
                                            will), the RESP&#8217;s contributions will go to the deceased
                                            subscriber&#8217;s estate. This would mean that a court would
                                            decide what happens with the money in the RESP, which could put
                                            the beneficiaries at risk of not receiving any mutual funds.</li>
                                    </ul>
